# Urban-octo-telegram-Homework

## Description

    The goal of this project was to take an existing webpage and make it more accessible.  I used semantic HTML elements to make the 
source code more readable.  I also restructured the CSS stylesheet to remove redundancies and make the job of any future developers easier when working on this website. 

## Installation

To view the project:
    1. First Download the zip file from the Urban-octo-telegram-Homework repository.
    2. Within the zip file should be a 'Develop' folder containing
        a) The webpage as 'index.html' 
        b) An Assets folder containg the css and images used on the webpage
    3. Use any browser or text editor of choice to view the files.
